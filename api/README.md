# Keep API

This project uses the [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi) client to make requests to the Google Keep api.

Although an official API for GKeep exists it does not yet service some features like labels which are crucial to the design of this application.

## Starting the API

To run the API run the following command:

```
./bootstrap.sh
```
